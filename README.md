# dramsoc-theme-child-moseia
Child theme to incorporate our customisations to the Moesia theme used on our website. The purpose of a child theme is to allow us to continue updating to new versions of the parent theme without breaking our own customisations.

This theme depends on the "Moesia" theme and it will have to be installed in the wordpress installation in order to function as it contains many of the neccesary files.
